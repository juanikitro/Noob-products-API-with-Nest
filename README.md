# Noob products API with Nest

This is my first Nest project done on the [Platzi course](https://platzi.com/cursos/nestjs/).

The application is based on a very simple "products" REST API where it is possible to use the 4 basic HTTP verbs.

In this app it was possible to understand the fundamentals of Nest: Controllers, services, pipes, validations, entities, etc.

## Instalation
```bash
```
